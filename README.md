# TIC TAC TOE Bot (Using the Min-Max algorithm)

Here is a fun little project I made, a TIC TAC TOE bot that is impossible to beat!. Don't believe me, just try it out :)
The Min-Max algorithm is a search algorithm that searches throught the space of possible combinations of any environment (in this case the tic tac toe game) and finds the most optimal configuration based on a "score". While you the player try to maximize the score, the bot on the other hand tries to minimize the score.

In the case of tic tac toe, if both players play optimally, the game always ends up in a draw, and if you make a mistake, well this bot will beat you!
This is fundamental beginnings to the field of AI and introduces a major problem of why we need AI for such problems.

There are many upgrades you can do to improve this game, such as Alpha-Beta pruning, and you are welcome to!
Clone the repo and try it out!
